Hello world. My name is Dima Gimburg and I decided to open a personal blog.
This is not my first take writing a blog but this time I promise to maintain it ü§ì.
I don't want to invest too much time in designing it, so I ask for your forgiveness beforehand.

I also don't wnat to focus on myself too much, so if you want to read a few words about me, go to the about page.
I am not a twitter fan so if you want contact me just PM me on facebook or my personal email.

I just want to mention one thing. This is a totally personal blog, so you don't have to agree with what I write.
I am always open for discussion, and I might be wrong, so I would be glad if someone corrects me, please do it.
I Hope someone finds my content helpful.

So let's start!

Cheers üçª
